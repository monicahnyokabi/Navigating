AS Buju Banton  words simply explains"When you rent a house you are forced to work with that structure you cant change the structure unless one undertakes the condition of the structure and adapt to it" 
We as Africans  have adopted a lot of things from the western culture which we use to today.The first thing is Education which most  of the Africans have now adapted to and most of them feels that they can't make in this life without undergoing it,the languages that we used in the western culture are still used by the Africans today.This is a progressive since more companies and jobs related to white collar jobs which have led to openmindness of the African nations  that a child without education cannot be helpful in the community where free scholarships have even increased.</p>
<p>The white collar jobs were also inherited from the western culture where every African is forced to undergo the same things that the westerns pertakes in their culture Since none of the black people are really bready to go on with the colonialism practices where a balck man had to work in a farm for a white man in order to get food and get a living where sometimes one could come out of the job without earning anything.Some Africans who also have large tracts of land where they practice Arable farming  and domestication have also started carrying out the same practices that colonialists brought where they employ labores to work for them.This is a  progressing structure since most of the Africans have lands and they employ many labores reducing the amount of unemployed people in the African nation </p>
<p>
	Africans have also inherited food from the colonialists but this has outomatically not gone beyond what Africans do and undertake since they have tried to come out with their assumptions of new foods and spices.The traditional foods which were introduced a while ago came out as outstanding sine Africans did not have much knowledge of technology and what they can make out of what they have
</p> 

<p>The western way of dressing has also advantages and several limitationssince some dressings are disliked by the old generation.The dressing code should be made decent in a way that every person including the old can have a positive thought about what they see the young generation wearing</p>
