                <h5>My REAL SElF</h5>
                <p>It wasnâ€™t until I read The Confidence Code by Katty Kay and Claire Shipman that I identified some of my deep-rooted fears of failure, my incessant perfectionism, and a zillion other feelings and traits which then suddenly became clear. There they were, systematically laid down before me. Each with an explanation. I began to meet, and challenge, my own ideas and assumptions about myself, one by one. After I started to understand my own self and my issues more closely, I started consciously trying to change the way I thought about myself and what I could do.  </p>
